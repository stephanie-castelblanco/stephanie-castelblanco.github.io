Empowering Parents: to lern to use computers 

The "Empowering Parents" project is an innovative initiative that seeks to bridge the digital gap by empowering parents with essential computer skills. It recognizes the importance of parental involvement in students' education and creates a supportive learning environment for parents to engage with their children's education. By providing basic to intermediate computer literacy skills, this project enhances digital skills that align with the technological advancements of today's society.
I had the opportunity to be a part of this beautiful project and was able to assist and teach high school parents to learn to use computers. We helped parents boost their confidence in utilizing computer technology and reinforce their learning through regular workshops, online learning modules, community events, and hands-on training sessions. The project also educates parents on online safety practices for themselves and their children, thus promoting digital safety.
By creating a supportive community, the project establishes a platform for parents to connect, share experiences, and support each other in their computer literacy journey through peer-to-peer learning and mentorship. The program evaluates and assesses the impact of the project through pre-and-post assessments, feedback surveys, and monitoring engagement.

The project requires the collaboration of workshop facilitators or trainers with expertise in computer literacy, access to devices for hands-on training, an online learning platform or website for module delivery, collaboration with teachers and school staff, and proper promotional materials and communication channels to reach parents.
The program aims to achieve sustainability by establishing partnerships with local organizations and volunteers encouraging a train-the-trainer model where participants can become mentors for future sessions. In the long run, this project aims to create a more inclusive and digitally connected school community by empowering parents with computer literacy skills.
