**Observation:** Japanese society values harmony and order. Observing the queue system, silence on public transportation, and adherence to unwritten rules showcased a collective commitment to maintaining a peaceful environment. Recognizing and adapting to these social norms became an integral part of experiencing daily life in Japan.

I recommend that future travelers who are planning to visit Japan should:
*	Research and prepare before the trip, such as learning some basic phrases and words in Japanese, checking the weather and seasonal events, and booking flights and accommodation in advance.

*	Be flexible and open-minded during the trip, such as trying new foods and activities, respecting the local rules and norms, and embracing the unexpected and the unfamiliar.

*	Enjoy and appreciate the trip, such as taking photos and videos, keeping a journal or a blog, and sharing the stories and memories with others.
