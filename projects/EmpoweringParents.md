Empowering Parents: to lern to use computers 

The "Empowering Parents" project is a groundbreaking initiative dedicated to closing the digital divide by providing crucial computer skills to parents. Recognizing the pivotal role parents play in their children's education, the project creates a nurturing learning environment to facilitate their engagement. Focused on delivering basic to intermediate computer literacy skills, the project equips parents with the digital knowledge needed to navigate today's technological landscape.

In my role within this impactful project, I had the privilege of actively contributing to the teaching and assistance provided to high school parents learning to use computers. Our efforts aimed to boost their confidence in utilizing technology, with a comprehensive approach involving workshops, online modules, community events, and hands-on training sessions. An integral aspect of the project involves educating parents on online safety practices, fostering awareness of digital safety for both themselves and their children.

The project goes beyond skill development; it fosters a sense of community among parents. Through peer-to-peer learning and mentorship, a supportive platform is established for parents to connect, share experiences, and bolster each other on their computer literacy journey. Continuous assessment through pre-and-post evaluations, feedback surveys, and engagement monitoring ensures the project's impact is effectively measured.

For successful implementation, collaboration with workshop facilitators, access to devices, an online learning platform, coordination with school staff, and robust promotional strategies are essential. The program's sustainability is emphasized through partnerships with local organizations, volunteer involvement, and a train-the-trainer model, empowering participants to become mentors for future sessions. Ultimately, the "Empowering Parents" project envisions a more inclusive and digitally connected school community shaped by the empowerment of parents with essential computer literacy skills.
