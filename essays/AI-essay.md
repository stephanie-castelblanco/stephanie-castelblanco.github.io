8.	**Asking or Answering a Smart Question:** I tried using AI to ask or answer complex questions but found the responses inadequate. This led me to seek clarification directly from my instructor.
9.	**Coding Example** (E.g., using Underscore .pluck):
    
#### Coding Example: Error Detection and Solution in React

Background: While working on a React project, I encountered a bug related to state management that caused the UI to not update correctly after state changes. This problem appeared under complex scenarios such as conditional rendering or during asynchronous operations.

#### Problem Code:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Issue Description: I was struggling to understand why the counter wasn't updating under certain conditions, which complicated debugging efforts.
AI-Assisted Solution: I discussed the issue with AI (specifically, ChatGPT), providing details about when the problem occurred and the symptoms. The AI suggested several 

#### troubleshooting steps:
- Functional Update: It recommended using a functional update form for setCount to ensure the count updates correctly based on the previous state, which is crucial in complex scenarios:

```
const increment = () => { setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); };
```

- Dependency Check: The AI advised checking all dependencies in any useEffect hooks to ensure they are correctly listed, addressing potential issues related to effect misfires.

#### Outcome: 
This guidance helped me think through the problem systematically, providing both specific coding solutions and general best practices. It significantly enhanced my understanding and efficiency in debugging, showcasing the practical benefits of AI in software development. <br />
