# “My Journey with Javascript: From Novice to future Expert”

I found learning JavaScript on freeCodeCamp to be a stimulating and engaging experience. My previous exposure to this language proved helpful during this module. The modules provided an excellent opportunity for beginners to learn fundamental concepts and practices of JavaScript. However, after completing several exercises on the same day, I felt exhausted and found them quite challenging. Based on my experience, I recommend practicing these exercises for no more than an hour daily. Although I enjoyed the materials, I wished we had more time to practice with a tutor and review the basics. Despite this, I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to study these modules and plan to delve even deeper into them when the chaos of the start of classes slows down.

Overall, this module provides a fantastic foundation for anyone looking to learn JavaScript and gain skills and confidence. The materials were well-organized and comprehensive, and I appreciate the amount of effort that went into creating them. The videos did a fantastic job explaining the exercises; if I ever meet someone who wants to learn JavaScript, freeCodeCamp will be my recommendation. It motivated me to learn more about JavaScript. 

When it comes to the athletic software engineering style, I must admit that I find it to be quite intimidating. However, I do understand that this is how it is going to be in the real world, and it is, therefore, important to start getting used to working under pressure and with people next to me. The athletic style of software engineering involves using a series of WODs, or "workout of the day" exercises, to practice coding skills. While this approach may seem daunting initially, I believe it will ultimately be very helpful for me. One of the things that I appreciate about this learning style is that it makes me feel engaged and curious about what I am doing. Rather than simply memorizing lines of code, I am forced to think critically about why I am using certain types of code and how they fit into the larger picture of the project. This approach also helps me to build my confidence and become more comfortable with the idea of working collaboratively with others.
While the athletic software engineering style may be challenging, I believe it will ultimately benefit me in the long run. It is helping me develop the skills and mindset necessary for success in software development's fast-paced and dynamic world.

I look forward to continuing my studies and seeing where this newfound knowledge will take me."
